A Minecraft Bedrock Tool to prevent you from going AFK (and getting kicked)

**It's easy to use and 100% effective. And it's completely safe.**

## How to use

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/patrickpissurno/bedrock-afk/releases/latest/download/BedrockAFK.exe)
2. Launch Minecraft Windows 10 Edition (it's the one from Microsoft Store, not the Java one)
3. Open **BedrockAFK** and choose one of the available modes (eg. Walk Forward)
4. Switch back to the game and enjoy

Once you're done with it, just head back to **BedrockAFK** and close the app.

### Notice
It is required that the game window be active (focused) for this tool to work, which means **you can't minimize the game and do something else while AFK on Minecraft**. While this is unfortunate, AFAIK there's no workaround for that due to the way Minecraft Bedrock and all other UWP apps work.

<br>

## How does it work
Under the hood **BedrockAFK** calls the Universal Windows Platform (UWP) APIs so that it can simulate keyboard and mouse presses on Minecraft. Due to the way it's implemented, it's virtually indistinguishable from actual user input.

<br>

## Available modes
1. Walk Forward (every now and then simulates the 'W' key being pressed)
2. Water Bucket (intended to be used with a water bucket, simulating the right mouse button)
3. AFK Fishing (fast) (intended to be used with an AFK fishing contraption, such as [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvsvFrILXJY))
4. AFK Fishing (slow) (same as above, but useful when not using a lure-enchanted fishing rod)

<br>

## Requirements
- Minecraft Windows 10 Edition (a.k.a. the Microsoft Store one)
- .NET Framework 4.7.2 (you shouldn't need to download it if you have Windows 10 1803 or later)
- Windows 10
